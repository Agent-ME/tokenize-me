Project Overview:
The goal is to create a modern, dynamic, and clean website for TokenizeMe, a platform for celebrities and content creators to tokenize their identities and generate revenue. The website will display the ideas, roadmap, tokenomics, and information about launching the coin on platforms like Moonshot/PumpFun.

Design Rules:
Clean & Modern Design:

Use a minimalist, premium aesthetic with a focus on simplicity.
Incorporate high-end, sleek design elements and typography that convey exclusivity and professionalism.
Maintain a balance between whitespace and content to enhance readability and focus.
Branding Consistency:

Use the TokenizeMe logo and the color palette (black, white and metallic tones).
Ensure the logo appears prominently, especially on the homepage, with a clean white background.
Typography:

Use modern sans-serif fonts such as Helvetica Neue, Gotham, or Proxima Nova for text.
For headings: Use bold, clean, uppercase text to convey strength and authority.
For body text: Use a simple, readable font style with a line height of 1.6 for better readability.
Navigation:

Keep navigation simple and intuitive, using a top navbar with links to key sections: About, Roadmap, Tokenomics, and Contact.
Provide a smooth scroll effect when clicking on links within the page.
Ensure that the logo in the top-left corner is clickable, leading users back to the homepage.
Responsiveness:

Make sure the site is mobile-responsive and adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes (phones, tablets, desktops).
The layout should be fluid, with stacked sections on mobile and larger, horizontally aligned sections on desktop.
Hero Section:

The homepage should feature a strong hero section with a headline such as "Empowering Celebrities & Creators with Personal Tokens" along with a call-to-action button like "Get Started" or "Learn More".
The background should be kept minimal, with the text centered for a clean and impactful look.
Include subtle animations (like fade-ins or scroll animations) to enhance engagement without overwhelming the user.
About Section:

Provide a clear, concise explanation of the platform's value proposition.
Use large, bold headings and icons to visually break up content and enhance understanding.
Include images or icons to represent creators, tokenization, and exclusivity.
Roadmap Section:

Present the roadmap using a timeline format or milestone markers. This could include months or quarters (e.g., Q1 2025, Q2 2025).
Use minimalist design elements (dots or lines) to visually represent each stage of development.
Include short descriptions with each roadmap item to keep the content engaging.
Tokenomics Section:

Present the token distribution and economics in an easy-to-understand format (e.g., pie charts or simple bullet points).
Break down the percentages clearly (Creator Distribution, Investor Rewards, Platform Development).
Use elegant animations to reveal tokenomics figures on scroll.
Footer Section:

Include minimal information in the footer: copyright notice, social media links, and contact information.
Keep the footer clean and unobtrusive with neutral tones to ensure focus remains on the main content.
Development Guidelines:
HTML Structure:

Use semantic HTML5 elements (<header>, <section>, <footer>, etc.) for a clean, accessible layout.
Ensure proper use of heading tags (<h1>, <h2>, <h3>) to improve SEO and content hierarchy.
CSS Styling:

Use Flexbox or Grid for layout, especially for responsive sections.
Focus on maintaining mobile-first design principles, ensuring the layout is visually appealing on all devices.
Use animations sparingly—such as hover effects on buttons or scroll animations for content—without cluttering the user experience.
JavaScript:

Implement smooth scrolling when users click navigation links.
Use minimal JavaScript for interactive elements, like the hero section button that scrolls to the next section or accordion-style roadmaps that expand on click.
Use JavaScript only where necessary to keep the site lightweight and fast.
SEO:

Ensure all images have alt text for accessibility and SEO.
Properly structure the content with heading tags, meta descriptions, and relevant keywords like NFTs, Celebrity Tokens, Tokenomics, etc.
Use clean URLs for each section (e.g., /roadmap, /tokenomics, etc.).
User Experience (UX) Guidelines:
Navigation:

Keep navigation clear and sticky at the top for easy access across long pages.
Focus on ease of use, ensuring that no user is more than two clicks away from important information.
Load Speed:

Optimize images and assets for fast loading times. Use lazy loading for non-critical images.
Minimize the use of heavy scripts or large files that can slow down page speed.
Calls to Action:

Use a strong call to action on the homepage (e.g., “Join the Revolution,” “Invest Now”).
Make sure all buttons stand out with a subtle hover effect or color change to encourage clicks.
